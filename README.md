## Installation
1. Clone and enter the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joestandring/dwm-bar
$ cd dwm-bar
```
2. Make the script executable
```
$ chmod +x dwm_bar.sh
```
## Recommendations
To make the most out of Unicode support, consider using a font that includes many Unicode characters. For example:
* [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
* [Siji](https://github.com/stark/siji)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

While not always necessary, it's a good idea to specify these fonts in your dwm config.
## Quick Start
Simply run the script and dwm should display your bar:
```
$ ./dwm_bar.sh
```
Most likely, you will need to change some values for functions to get them to work - these are outlined with a comment for functions where this is likely the case.
If you would like your bar to be displayed when X starts, add this to your .xinitrc file before launching dwm. For example, if the script is located in /home/$USER/dwm-bar/:
```
# Statusbar
/home/$USER/dwm-bar/dwm_bar.sh &

# Start dwm
exec dwm
```
## Customizing
dwm-bar is completely modular, meaning you can mix and match functions to your heart's content. It's functions are located in the bar-functions/ subdirectory and included in dwm_bar.sh
If you want to make your own function, for example, dwm_myfunction.sh, you should create it in the bar-functions/ subdirectory before including it in dwm_bar.sh and adding it to the xsetroot command:
```
# Import the modules
. "$DIR/bar-functions/dwm_myfucntion"

while true
do
    xsetroot -name "$(dwm_myfunction)"
    sleep 1
done
```
You can also decide to use Unicode or plaintext identifiers for functions by altering the ```$IDENTIFIER``` value. For example, set to ```"unicode"```, ```dwm_mail``` will display:
```
[📫 0]
```
Whereas, if it is not set it will display:
```
[MAIL 0]
```
